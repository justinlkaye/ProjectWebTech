  <h1>Ski Lift Website Proposal</h1>
  <h2>
    What is my website about?
  </h2>
  <p>
    My website is about ski lift information for ski resorts. The website will provide information about the ski lifts
    such as lift name, location, type of lift, and more. I may also consider discussing how to optimize the best day on
    the mountain and discuss stuff like
    which parking lot is best!
  </p>
  <h2>
    What is the objective of my website?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The objective of the website is to provide skiers and snowboarders with comprehensive information about the ski
    lifts at different ski resorts. This will help them plan their ski trips better and make the most out of their
    experience on the slopes.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Who is my target audience?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The target audience of the website is skiers and snowboarders who are planning a ski trip. The website will be
    useful for both beginners and experienced skiers, as well as families and groups of friends who are looking to ski
    together.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The website will have the following pages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Homepage - A brief introduction to the website and its purpose</li>
    <li>Ski Resorts - A list of ski resorts and their ski lift information</li>
    <li>Lift Information - Detailed information about each ski lift, including lift name, type of lift, location, and
      more</li>
    <li>Map - An interactive map displaying the location of ski lifts in different ski resorts</li>
    <li>Sitemap - A comprehensive sitemap of all the pages on the website</li>
  </ul>
